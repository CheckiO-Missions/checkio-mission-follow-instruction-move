            To make four steps forward with length 1 is the same as to jump forward once with length 4. So, you need to count the total number of steps in each direction and then find two correct differences between these numbers.

            In our case counting the number of steps in each direction means to count a number of each unique letter in the <b class="code">instructions</b>. Since <b class="code">instructions</b> is a string, you may use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_count.asp">string.count()</a> method, which does exactly this! Declare a new variable, let in be <b class="code">c</b> with the value of method.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
instructions = "ffbrl"
c = instructions.count
        </pre>
    </div>

            Now you may call this method four times (with different argument for each direction) and find out your total shift in each direction. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
instructions = "ffbrl"
c = instructions.count
print(c("r"), c("l"), c("f"), c("b"))
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>

            How to transform these shifts into the final coordinates?

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You should think about opposite directions, on the same axis. If you make four steps forward and then two steps backward, what is your final shift on this axis?
        </p>
        <p>
            From the description you may see that the first coordinate has positive direction right and negative direction left (when the step is <b class="code">"l"</b>, this coordinate decreases), the second coordinate has positive direction forward and negative - backward (when the step is <b class="code">"f"</b>, this coordinates increases).

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Your final coordinate in each axis is a difference between respective shifts in positive and negative directions. Let's declare two variables and find these differences.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
axis_rl = c("r") - c("l")
axis_fb = c("f") - c("b")

        <i>So, how my final solution should look like?</i>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You need to combine previous hints, wrap the whole code into function expression and return the tuple of two variables, that stores final coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the whole solution:</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def follow(instructions: str) -> tuple[int, int] | list[int]:

    c = instructions.count
    axis_fb = c('f') - c('b')
    axis_rl = c('r') - c('l')
    
    return axis_rl, axis_fb 
        </pre>
    </div>

        <p>
            In this solution you make calculations in <b class="code">for</b> loop and update pre-declared variables, taking into consideration the axis for each move. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def follow(instructions: str) -> tuple[int, int] | list[int]:

    move = {"f": 1, "b": -1, "l": -1, "r": 1}
    x = y = 0
    for i in instructions:
        x += move[i] * (i in "lr")
        y += move[i] * (i in "fb")

    return x, y
        </pre>
        <p>
            You may compress all the logic in one line using <b class="code">lambda</b> expression (anonymous function) and list comprehension.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
follow = lambda i: [i.count(x)-i.count(y) for x, y in ('rl', 'fb')]
        </pre>
